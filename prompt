Create Borrowed asset listing where it shows asset from reservation_borrowing the date of return is coming.

Remove Consumables by Status and create Listing for Consumables that below 10 the quantity. If there's no quantity below 10, just show the lowest. Always top 7.

Nothing will change there, only this:

If user select 'no' in availability
    - make the dropdown for status into complete
    - populate the Quantity Issued with '0' and disabled it
    - don't let them submit it if the Borrow Remarks is blank.

NOTE: it is working, i hope you dont broke it.
